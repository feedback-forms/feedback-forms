# Feedback Forms Refactoring Checklist

This document outlines recommended improvements to enhance code quality, maintainability, and adherence to best practices in the Feedback Forms application.

## Database & Model Architecture

- [x] **Standardize model naming conventions** - Models like `Feedback_template` use snake_case instead of Laravel's conventional PascalCase (e.g., `FeedbackTemplate`)
- [x] ~~**Evaluate the `already_answered` field** - This field appears to be redundant as it's calculated dynamically via `getSubmissionCountAttribute()`~~
- [x] **Consolidate duplicate query logic** - Several repeated database queries exist in `Feedback` model methods (`getSubmissionCountAttribute`, `getUniqueSubmissionsCount`, etc.)
- [x] **Review relationship naming conventions** - Some relationship methods use snake_case (e.g., `feedback_template()`) instead of camelCase
- [x] **Consider implementing soft deletes** - Implemented for the Feedback model to preserve survey data even when records are "deleted"

## Service Layer

- [x] ~~**Break down `SurveyService`** - This class exceeds 1600 lines and handles too many responsibilities, violating the Single Responsibility Principle~~
- [x] ~~**Implement template strategy pattern** - Template-specific logic is scattered with conditionals; could be refactored into dedicated strategy classes~~
- [x] **Extract statistics calculation** - Move statistics logic from `SurveyService` to a dedicated `StatisticsService`
- [x] ~~**Reduce method sizes** - Methods like `storeResponses()` and `storeTemplateSpecificResponses()` are excessively long and complex~~
- [x] **Standardize error handling** - Inconsistent error handling approaches exist across service methods

## View Layer

- [x] ~~**Extract business logic from Blade templates** - `statistics.blade.php` contains complex PHP logic that should be moved to controllers/services~~
- [x] **Convert repeated template structures to components** - Many templates have similar patterns that could be reused via components
- [ ] **Refactor Alpine.js usage** - Consider organizing Alpine.js code into dedicated JavaScript files for larger interactive components
- [x] **Implement view models** - Use view models or data transfer objects to reduce complex data transformation in templates

## Code Organization & Architecture

- [ ] **Consistent repository pattern usage** - Repository pattern is used for some models but not others
- [ ] **Improve error logging** - Current error logging includes raw exceptions that could be better structured and categorized
- [ ] **Extract form request validation** - Move complex validation logic from services/controllers to dedicated form request classes
- [ ] **Enhance API documentation** - PHPDoc comments are inconsistent across the codebase

## Performance Considerations

- [ ] **Review N+1 query issues** - Check for potential N+1 query problems, especially in statistics generation
- [ ] **Implement caching** - Consider caching for frequently accessed statistics data
- [ ] **Query optimization** - Review complex queries in `SurveyService` and `Feedback` model for optimization opportunities
- [ ] **Index usage evaluation** - Review if all required indexes are properly defined for performance-critical queries

## Code Quality & Standards

- [x] **Internationalize hardcoded strings** - Various hardcoded strings throughout the codebase should use Laravel's localization
- [x] ~~**Remove commented-out code** - Clean up commented code and "TODO" items that are no longer relevant~~
- [x] ~~**Standardize method return type declarations** - Many methods lack proper return type declarations~~
- [x] ~~**Improve variable naming** - Some variables have generic names (`$data`, `$result`, etc.) that could be more descriptive~~

## Security Considerations

- [ ] **Review authorization controls** - Ensure proper authorization checks are in place for all survey operations
- [ ] **Validate survey access mechanisms** - Review the access key generation and validation logic for potential issues
- [ ] **Input validation** - Enhance input validation for user-submitted survey responses

## Testing Improvements

- [ ] **Increase test coverage** - Add or enhance tests for critical components, especially around survey submission and statistics
- [ ] **Implement integration tests** - Focus on testing the interaction between components
- [ ] **Create test factories** - Ensure all models have appropriate factory definitions for testing

## Technical Debt

- [ ] **Address deprecated functionality** - Legacy functionality and conditionals marked with comments like "can be removed after frontend updates"
- [ ] **Review database migration sequence** - Consider consolidating incremental migrations that modify the same tables
- [ ] **Document complex algorithms** - Improve documentation for complex calculations in `SurveyAggregationService`
- [ ] **Fix inconsistent coding styles** - Ensure adherence to a consistent coding style throughout the codebase
